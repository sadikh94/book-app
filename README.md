Project Name: Book App

Description:
The Book App is a personal pet project that provides a feature-rich platform for managing your book collection. With this application, you can easily sort books by genre, add and remove books, mark your favorites, create new book entries, search for specific titles, and all of your data is stored and managed using a JSON server. A backup of the database (db.json) is available in case you need to revert changes since modifications directly impact the data.

Getting Started:
To run the project, simply execute the following two commands:

npm start
npm run start:db
Explore your book collection and enjoy effortless book management with the Book App.
